Must have tests
- TEST preprocessNewPassword does not cover normalize test case
- TEST hashPassword cannot run, then runs...
- TEST createKey - intergration test? do we need to test this as each function is tested?
- TEST createKeyPair, does it need a test?
- TEST Create test to ensure userKey class variables are assigned correctly
- TEST Create test to ensure passwords don't need to meet regex
- TEST CreateSecretKey test
    - Ensure CreateSecretKey does NOT hash the secret
- TEST password key has salt when passing to createpasswordkey - maybe create a type
- INTERGRATION TEST = userKey Class and workflow

- TEST FAILURE Test suite fails for unknown reason

Optional 
- Optional Regex's for passwords, select the password schema 
- Optional hash rounds for password hashing
- Types rather than Regex?
- Types for number range in createKeyOpts
- Key length const defined in createKey could be a global interchangable variable at start up

Persistance 
- Hash will need to be persisted, currently only sits within createNewPasswordKey
